        q: "Is Buying a pass worth it?",
        a: "We have never released anything like this for this low of a price! Everyone values time, tools, and information differently. We believe the value of holding this pass will far outweigh the mint price, but it is up to you to decide if it's worth it to you. Our commitment is to underpromise and overdeliver."

        q: "Is there a Discord for community communication regarding this NFT?",
        a: "Yes, we have moderators and team members ready to field your questions and to make announcements regarding the NFT. There will be a chance for you to also get on our Whitelist to allow early minting and guarantee yourself an UNBREAKABLE pass.",

        q: "What wallet do I need to store my NFT?",
        a: <p>We suggest a Metamask wallet. It's very simple to download and It's free. All you need to do is head on
            over to <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">metamask.io</a> and
            download the wallet, add the chrome extension to your computer if you have one, and write down or print out
            your seedphrase. Do not take a picture of it. Put it in your safe in case you need to access it in the
            future. You can also download the Metamask wallet to your smartphone and import your wallet as well using
            your seedphrase. Again, this is all very simple and we will release easy to understand tutorial videos for
            you prior to mint.</p>,
